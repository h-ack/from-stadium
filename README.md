# From stadium

[From stadium](http://h-ack.github.com/from-stadium) is an experiment about soccer match events visualization.

A slider is the main interaction object. The slide symbolizes match time from 0' to 90'. Match events are attached to the slide at the right time portion.

**Notes:**

 * a user should be able to interact with the slider also using the keayboard (hjkl).
 * a user should be able to select a match and navigate through its events by moving the slider.

The app shows a flow of pictures (from Instagram) and posts (from Twitter) expanding and shrinking while moving the slider. Pictures and posts are from places near the stadium location and related to match events by their creation time.
